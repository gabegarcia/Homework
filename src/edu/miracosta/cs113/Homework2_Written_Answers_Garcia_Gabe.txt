The original RandomClue driver did not return the correct solution on 20 or less guesses
for any of the options (1, 2, 3).

Options 1, and 2 seemed to require less guesses than option 3.

The bad element in the original strategy is that it uses random guesses for 3 variables.
All 3 variables must match the solution which is the most difficult to do.

The good part of this strategy is that it does work; it eventually finds a solution.
